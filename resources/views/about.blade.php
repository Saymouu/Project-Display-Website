                    This is just an example about section I wrote to fill up the space. This here is just my internship project. I found this template online on a site that offers
                    many different variations of the theme which is open source, and you can use it for any purpose, personal or commercial.

        </div>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/ipad.png" alt="..." />
    </div>
